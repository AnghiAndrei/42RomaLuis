Step 1: Choose an Installation Directory

You can choose any directory within your home directory, for example, ~/homebrew.

sh

mkdir ~/homebrew

Step 2: Clone the Homebrew Repository

Clone the Homebrew repository into the directory you created:

sh

git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.git ~/homebrew

Step 3: Add Homebrew to Your PATH

You need to add Homebrew to your PATH. Open your shell profile file (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc) with a text editor:

sh

nano ~/.bashrc

or for zsh:

sh

nano ~/.zshrc

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

sh

# Homebrew configuration
export PATH="$HOME/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
eval "$($HOME/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

Save the file and exit the text editor.
Step 4: Apply the Changes

Source your shell profile to apply the changes:

sh

source ~/.bashrc

or for zsh:

sh

source ~/.zshrc

Step 5: Verify the Installation

Check if Homebrew is installed correctly by running:

sh

brew --version

You should see the Homebrew version output, indicating that the installation was successful.
Step 6: Install Dependencies with Homebrew

Now you can use Homebrew to install any dependencies you might need. For example, if build-essential is missing, you can try:

sh

brew install gcc

By following these steps, you manually install Homebrew in a location where you have write permissions and configure your environment to use it. This method bypasses the need for sudo entirely.
